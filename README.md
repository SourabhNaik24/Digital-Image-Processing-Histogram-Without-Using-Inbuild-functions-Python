# Digital-Image-Processing-Histogram-Without-Using-Inbuild-functions-Python

Histogram of an image:
Histogram of an image, like other histograms also shows frequency. But an image histogram, shows frequency of pixels intensity values. In an image histogram, the x axis shows the gray level intensities and the y axis shows the frequency of these intensities.
The x axis of the histogram shows the range of pixel values. Since its an 8 bpp image, that means it has 256 levels of gray or shades of gray in it. Thats why the range of x axis starts from 0 and end at 255 with a gap of 50. Whereas on the y axis, is the count of these intensities.

Applications of Histograms:
Histograms has many uses in image processing. The first use as it has also been discussed above is the analysis of the image. We can predict about an image by just looking at its histogram. Its like looking an x ray of a bone of a body.
The second use of histogram is for brightness purposes. The histograms has wide application in image brightness. Not only in brightness, but histograms are also used in adjusting contrast of an image.
Another important use of histogram is to equalize an image.
And last but not the least, histogram has wide use in thresholding. This is mostly used in computer vision.
